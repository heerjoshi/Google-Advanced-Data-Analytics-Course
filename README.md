# **Salifort Motors Employee Retention Project**

## **Overview**

The Salifort Motors Employee Retention Project is the capstone project for the Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate program. This project aims to analyze employee survey data to develop a predictive model for employee attrition and identify the key factors contributing to turnover. The insights gained from this analysis can help Salifort Motors make informed decisions to improve employee retention.

## **Project Objectives**

- Predict employee attrition using survey data.
- Identify the key factors contributing to employee turnover.
- Provide actionable recommendations to improve employee retention.

## **Dataset**

The dataset used for this project is based on employee survey data from Salifort Motors. It includes various attributes such as satisfaction level, tenure, number of projects, last evaluation scores, average monthly hours, work accidents, and other relevant factors.

## **Tools & Technologies**

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, XGBoost, matplotlib, seaborn
- **Machine Learning Models:** Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression
- **Jupyter Notebook:** For data analysis and modeling

## **Data Analysis Process**

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Initial exploration to understand the dataset, handle missing values, and identify key features.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Created new features and transformed existing ones to improve model performance.
3. **Model Building:** Developed predictive models using Random Forest, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression.
4. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluated model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. **Feature Importance Analysis:** Identified the most important factors influencing employee attrition.

## **Key Insights**

- The most influential factors in predicting employee attrition are satisfaction level, tenure, number of projects, last evaluation score, and average monthly hours.
- The Random Forest model slightly outperformed the XGBoost model in predicting employee attrition.
- Employees who work on too many projects, have longer working hours, or have low satisfaction levels are more likely to leave the company.

## **Conclusion**

This project helps predict employee turnover and provides actionable insights for improving employee retention at Salifort Motors. The findings offer guidance on how to create a more engaging and rewarding work environment for employees.
